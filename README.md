# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks
A collection of python notebooks used to solve Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for phase change material problems.

## Current Progress
Working on Res-Net based architecture

## Previously Attempted
- Transfer Learning based time stepping methodologies
- Gradient enhanced PINN
- Coupling of gradient and evolutionary optimiser(genetic algorithm)
