# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks
A collection of python notebooks used to solve Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for phase change material problems.

## Current Progress
Working on Res-Net based architecture

## Previously Attempted
- Transfer Learning, RNN and GRU based time stepping methodologies. 
- Gradient enhanced PINN
- Coupling of gradient and evolutionary optimiser(genetic algorithm)

## Architecture
- General Architecture of PINN.
